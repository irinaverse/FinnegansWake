## Applying the tools of mathematics to the data of language
James Joyce's masterpiece "Finnegans Wake" is considered the most difficult book ever written in the Western World. It is hardly possible to read and an arduous task for humans. With the help of modern Data Science, I am sallying forth to find the secret of Mr. Joyce joyous writings:
- the book forms a cycle
- photo of James Joyce, year 1918
- building a text corpus
- pos_tag (Part of Speech tagging)
- find words, sentences, punctuations
- distributional structure in language
- notice the takt and word movement
- detect mistakes, always check-up your data
- amazing work in progress in part IV...
