## Applying the tools of mathematics to the data of language

James Joyce's masterpiece *Finnegans Wake* is considered the most complex text ever written in the Western World. It is hardly possible to read and an arduous task for humans. With the help of Data Science, I'm sallying forth to explore Mr. Joyce joyous writings.

<br />

Please, start reading from notebook Part IV:
- the whole book is a $360^{\circ}$ story
- photo of James Joyce, year 1918
- building text corpus
- pos_tag (Part of Speech tagging)
- words, sentences, punctuations
- distributional structure in language
- notice the takt and word movement
- detect mistakes in the study, always check-up your data
- "Yes!" exponential growth is "Oyes! Oyeses! Oyesesyeses!"
<br />

Followed by Part I:
- "Hohohoho, Mister Finn, you’re going to be Mister Finnagain!"
- building text corpus
- the sound of words
- first discovered sentence is the math Δ sentence
- selecting with pandas
- the most complex section, including *iSpace*
- Yes!, James Joyce nailed it 100 years ago, with the term *iSpace*
